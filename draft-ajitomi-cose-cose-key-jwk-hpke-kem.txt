1.  Introduction

   Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) [RFC9180], published by the
   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), has already been adopted in
   several communication protocol specifications such as TLS Encrypted
   Client Hello (ECH), Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH) and Oblivious
   HTTP (OHTTP).  HPKE itself is communication protocol independent and
   can be widely used as a standard scheme for public key based end-to-
   end encryption in various applications, not only in communication
   protocols.

   In HPKE, the sender of a ciphertext needs to know in advance not only
   the recipient public key, but also the HPKE mode, the KEM associated
   with the key, and the set of supported KDF and AEAD algorithms.  The
   data structure of this information (hereafter referred to as HPKE key
   configuration information) is defined in each communication protocol
   specification that uses HPKE.  For example, the ECH defines it as a
   structure called HpkeKeyConfig.  When using HPKE in an application,
   it is necessary to define the data structure corresponding to the
   HpkeKeyConfig and how the information is transferred from the
   recipient to the sender.  If the data structure and the publication
   method for the HPKE key configuration information were standardized,
   it would be easier to use HPKE in applications.

   This document defines how to represent a KEM key for HPKE and the
   HPKE key configuration information in JSON Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517]
   and COSE_Key defined in CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
   Structures and Process [RFC9052].  Specifically, this document
   defines (1) a common key parameter for defining the HPKE key
   configuration information in existing key types that can be used for
   key derivation and (2) a generic key type for HPKE that can also be
   used to represent post-quantum KEM keys to be specified in the
   future.  By using the generic key type for HPKE, all KEM keys
   registered in the IANA HPKE registry can be represented in JWK and
   COSE_Key without the need to define cryptographic algorithm-specific
   key types and parameters such as for EC or RSA as defined in
   [RFC7518] and [RFC9053].

   The ability to include HPKE-related information in JWK, which is
   widely used not only as the public key representation but also as the
   key publication method (via the JWK Set endpoint) at the application
   layer, and its binary representation, COSE_Key, will facilitate the
   use of HPKE in a wide variety of web applications and communication
   systems for constrained devices.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Common Key Parameter for HPKE Key Configuration

   The HPKE key configuration information is defined as a common key
   parameter of JWK and COSE_Key.  The parameter can be specified in the
   key that can be used for key derivation.  In addition, the handling
   of existing key parameters is also defined.

3.1.  JWK Parameter

3.1.1.  "hkc" (HPKE Key Configuration) Parameter

   The "hkc" (KPKE key configuration) parameter identifies the KEM for
   the recipient key and the set of KDF and AEAD algorithms supported by
   the recipient.  A JWK used for HPKE KEM MUST have this parameter.  It
   MUST contain the object consisting of the following three attributes.

   *  "kem": The HPKE KEM identifier, which is a two-byte value
      registered in the IANA HPKE registry.

   *  "kdfs": The array of the HPKE KDF identifiers supported by the
      recipient.  The KDF identifier is also a two-byte value registered
      in the IANA HPKE registry.

   *  "aeads": The array of the HPKE AEAD identifiers supported by the
      recipient.  The AEAD identifier is also a two-byte value
      registered in the IANA HPKE registry.

   The "hkc" parameter can be used with existing "EC" [RFC7518] and
   "OKP" [RFC8037] keys and the keys for future post-quantum KEMs.

3.1.2.  Restrictions on the Use of Existing Key Parameters

   The restrictions on the use of existing common key parameters in a
   JWK for HPKE KEM are as follows:

   *  "alg": The parameter MUST be present and contains one of the
      following values:

      -  "HPKE-v1-Base"

      -  "HPKE-v1-PSK"

      -  "HPKE-v1-Auth"

      -  "HPKE-v1-AuthPSK"

   *  "use": The parameter SHOULD NOT be specified.  If specified, it
      MUST be "enc".

   *  "key_ops": The parameter SHOULD NOT be specified.  If specified,
      it MUST include "deriveKey" and/or "deriveBits".

   *  etc.

3.2.  COSE Key Common Parameter

3.2.1.  hkc (HPKE Key Configuration) Parameter

   The HPKE key configuration parameter for COSE_Key is defined as
   follows:

   *  hkc (HPKE Key Configuration): The parameter MUST contain an array
      structure named HPKE_Key_Configuration, which contains the same
      information as "hkc" in JWK above.  The CDDL grammar describing
      the HPKE_Key_Configuration structure is:

   HPKE_Key_Configuration = [
       kem: uint,              ; KEM identifier
       kdfs: uint / [+uint],   ; KDF identifiers
       aeads: uint / [+uint],  ; AEAD identifiers
   ]

      +---------+----------------+-------------+----------------------+
      | Name    | CBOR Type      | Value       | Description          |
      |         |                | Registry    |                      |
      +---------+----------------+-------------+----------------------+
      | kem     | uint           | HPKE KEM    | The KEM identifier   |
      |         |                | Identifiers | bound to the key     |
      |         |                |             |                      |
      | kdfs    | uint / [+uint] | HPKE KDF    | The KDF identifiers  |
      |         |                | Identifiers | supported by the     |
      |         |                |             | recipient            |
      |         |                |             |                      |
      | aeads   | uint / [+uint] | HPKE AEAD   | The AEAD identifiers |
      |         |                | Identifiers | supported by the     |
      |         |                |             | recipient            |
      |         |                |             |                      |
      +---------+----------------+-------------+----------------------+

   The hkc parameter can be used with existing OKP and EC2 keys
   [RFC9053] and the keys for future post-quantum KEMs.

3.2.2.  Restrictions on the Use of Existing Key Parameters

   The restrictions on the use of existing common key parameters in a
   COSE_Key for the HPKE KEM are as follows:

   *  alg(3): The parameter MUST be present and contains one of the
      following values:

      -  HPKE-v1-Base (T.B.D.)

      -  HPKE-v1-PSK (T.B.D.)

      -  HPKE-v1-Auth (T.B.D.)

      -  HPKE-v1-AuthPSK (T.B.D.)

   *  key_ops(4): The parameter SHOULD NOT be specified.  If specified,
      it MUST include "derive key"(7) and/or "derive bits"(8).

   *  etc.

4.  Generic Key Type for HPKE KEM

   A generic key type for the HPKE KEM keys including a post-quantum KEM
   defined in the future is defined.  Even KEM keys that can be
   represented by existing key types can use the generic key type
   defined here.

4.1.  Key Type for JWK

   A new generic key type (kty) value "HPKE-KEM" is defined to represent
   the private and public key used for the HPKE KEM.  A key with this
   kty has the following parameters:

   *  The parameter "kty" MUST be "HPKE-KEM".

   *  The parameter "hkc" MUST be present and contains the HPKE Key
      Configuration defined in Section 3.1.1.

   *  The parameter "pub" MUST be present and contains the public key
      encoded using the base64url [RFC4648] encoding.

   *  The parameter "priv" MUST be present if the key is private key and
      contains the private key encoded using the base64url [RFC4648]
      encoding.

4.2.  Key Type for COSE_Key

   A new generic kty(1) value HPKE-KEM(T.B.D.) is defined to represent
   the private and public key used for the HPKE KEM.  A key with this
   kty has the following parameters:

   *  The parameter kty(1) MUST be HPKE-KEM(T.B.D).

   *  The parameter hkc(T.B.D.)  MUST be present and contains the HPKE
      Key Configuration defined in Section 3.2.1.

   *  The parameter pub(-1) MUST be present and contains the public key
      encoded in a byte string (bstr type).

   *  The parameter priv(-2) MUST be present if the key is private key
      and contains the private key encoded in a byte string (bstr type).
